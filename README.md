# Renting Project 

It's a web application meant to help tenants to search for the right flat according to their desired preferences. It has been made using JS, HTML, CSS.

## Usage
Open the file index.html that is located in the root of the project. Make sure to open it using the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension of Visual Studio Code to get it workig right. The reason to run this application using this extension is because it is using Local Storage which requires a different protocol that ```file```. 
        
Once you run the server the login screen should be shown first.
